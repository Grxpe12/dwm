<h1>My dwm dotfiles.</h1>

Featuring an autoinstall.sh script for automated installation of the dotfiles.
You need the [rsync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsync) package to ensure the script works fine.

It is subject to change, since I still work on it and will continue to, keep an eye for changes.

<h2>Installation</h2>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grxpe12/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo ./autoinstall.sh
```
